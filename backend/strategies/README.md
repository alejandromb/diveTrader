## Strategy Architecture

All strategies follow a common interface:

```python
class Strategy:
    def __init__(self, strategy_id, trading_service, db_session, config)
    def start()           # Initialize and start the strategy
    def stop()            # Stop strategy and close positions
    def run_iteration()   # Execute one strategy cycle
    def get_status()      # Get current strategy status
```

## Risk Management Integration

All strategies integrate with the **Risk Management System**:
- **Position Sizing**: Automatic calculation based on risk per trade
- **Drawdown Limits**: Stop trading when drawdown exceeds limits
- **Daily Loss Limits**: Halt trading if daily losses exceed threshold
- **Trade Validation**: Every trade is validated before execution

## Event Logging

Strategies automatically log events:
- **Strategy Lifecycle**: Start/stop events
- **Trade Checks**: Market analysis and signal generation
- **Order Execution**: Trade placement and fills
- **Risk Alerts**: Risk management warnings and stops
- **Performance Updates**: P&L and metrics tracking

View detailed logs through the **üìã Event Logs** button in the UI.

## Adding New Strategies

To add a new trading strategy:

1. **Create Strategy Class** in this directory
2. **Implement Required Methods**: `start()`, `stop()`, `run_iteration()`, `get_status()`
3. **Add to Strategy Types** in `database/models.py`
4. **Update Strategy Runner** in `services/strategy_runner.py`
5. **Add UI Configuration** in frontend components

## Configuration Format

Strategies are configured via JSON in the database:

    "max_daily_loss": 5.0,
    "max_drawdown": 15.0
  }
}
```

## Testing & Backtesting
